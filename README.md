## Deploying on Cloudera Machine Learning (CML)
-----
There are three ways to launch this notebook on CML:

### TODO: fix links!

* **From Prototype Catalog** - Navigate to the Prototype Catalog in a CML workspace, select the "Analyzing News Headlines with SpaCy" tile, click "Launch as Project", click "Configure Project"
* **As ML Prototype** - In a CML workspace, click "New Project", add a Project Name, select "ML Prototype" as the Initial Setup option, copy in the repo URL, click "Create Project", click "Configure Project"
* **Manual Setup** - In a CML workspace, click "New Project", add a Project Name, select "Git" as the Initial Setup option, copy in the repo URL, click "Create Project".

Once the project has been initialized in a CML workspace, run the notebook by starting a Python 3 Jupyter notebook server session. All library and model dependencies are installed inline in the notebook.

Happy hacking!
